# checking-duplicate-domains
This bash script identifies duplicate domains in a specified file. It sorts the domain list, detects duplicates, and highlights them in red. If no duplicates are found, it confirms this with a green message. Ideal for ensuring domain lists are unique and clean, useful for security researchers and administrators.
